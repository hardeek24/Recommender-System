# Recommender System Project

## Overview

This project focuses on building a robust recommender system using collaborative filtering, matrix factorization, and neural networks. The system is designed to provide personalized recommendations by analyzing user behavior and preferences. Leveraging Amazon SageMaker for model training and deployment, along with Amazon S3 for efficient data storage and management, ensures scalability and performance.

## Features

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Utilizes user-item interactions to predict user preferences.
- **Matrix Factorization**: Decomposes the user-item interaction matrix to discover latent factors representing users and items.
- **Neural Networks**: Applies deep learning techniques to capture complex patterns and improve recommendation accuracy.
- **Amazon SageMaker**: Facilitates model training, tuning, and deployment in a scalable environment.
- **Amazon S3**: Manages data storage, ensuring efficient access and retrieval.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/recommender-system.git
   cd recommender-system
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up AWS Credentials**:
   Ensure your AWS credentials are configured to access SageMaker and S3.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**:
   Upload your dataset to an S3 bucket. Update the data paths in the configuration file.

2. **Training the Model**:
   Use Amazon SageMaker to train the model. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

3. **Model Deployment**:
   Deploy the trained model using SageMaker for real-time predictions:
   ```bash
   python deploy.py
   ```

4. **Making Predictions**:
   Use the deployed endpoint to make recommendations:
   ```python
   from inference import get_recommendations
   recommendations = get_recommendations(user_id)
   ```
