# Recommender System Project

## Overview

This project focuses on building a robust recommender system using collaborative filtering, matrix factorization, and neural networks. The system is designed to provide personalized recommendations by analyzing user behavior and preferences. Leveraging Amazon SageMaker for model training and deployment, along with Amazon S3 for efficient data storage and management, ensures scalability and performance.

## Problem Statement

In today's digital age, users are inundated with vast amounts of content, products, and services. Whether it's streaming media, online shopping, or reading articles, the challenge lies in helping users discover relevant items efficiently and accurately. Traditional recommendation systems often struggle with scalability and the ability to capture complex user-item interactions.

This project aims to address these challenges by developing an advanced recommender system. The primary goals are:

1. **Personalization**: Provide tailored recommendations that match individual user preferences and behaviors.
2. **Scalability**: Ensure the system can handle large datasets and a growing number of users and items without significant performance degradation.
3. **Accuracy**: Improve the precision of recommendations by leveraging state-of-the-art algorithms and deep learning techniques.
4. **Efficiency**: Optimize data storage and model deployment to ensure quick response times and efficient use of resources.

By integrating collaborative filtering, matrix factorization, and neural networks, this project seeks to create a hybrid model that leverages the strengths of each approach. Amazon SageMaker is utilized for its robust machine learning capabilities, while Amazon S3 provides scalable and efficient data management.

## Features

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Utilizes user-item interactions to predict user preferences.
- **Matrix Factorization**: Decomposes the user-item interaction matrix to discover latent factors representing users and items.
- **Neural Networks**: Applies deep learning techniques to capture complex patterns and improve recommendation accuracy.
- **Amazon SageMaker**: Facilitates model training, tuning, and deployment in a scalable environment.
- **Amazon S3**: Manages data storage, ensuring efficient access and retrieval.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/recommender-system.git
   cd recommender-system
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up AWS Credentials**:
   Ensure your AWS credentials are configured to access SageMaker and S3.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**:
   Upload your dataset to an S3 bucket. Update the data paths in the configuration file.

2. **Training the Model**:
   Use Amazon SageMaker to train the model. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

3. **Model Deployment**:
   Deploy the trained model using SageMaker for real-time predictions:
   ```bash
   python deploy.py
   ```

4. **Making Predictions**:
   Use the deployed endpoint to make recommendations:
   ```python
   from inference import get_recommendations
   recommendations = get_recommendations(user_id)
   ```
